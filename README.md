## Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model to analyze and predict employee turnover within an organization. By identifying key factors that contribute to employee exits, this model assists HR departments in implementing preventive measures to retain valuable talent.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building using machine learning algorithms. Evaluation metrics are used to assess model performance, ensuring accuracy in predicting whether an employee is likely to leave.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and scaling are performed to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The data is visualized and statistically analyzed to uncover trends and correlations related to employee turnover.
- **Model Building:** Machine learning models are trained and tested to identify the best-performing one based on predictive accuracy and other relevant metrics.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to evaluate model performance.

## Table of Results

The table of results contains details about model performance across various algorithms or parameter settings. Each row typically includes:

- **Model:** The type of model used (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
- **Accuracy:** The percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
- **Precision:** The proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct.
- **Recall:** The proportion of actual positives that are correctly predicted.
- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single measure of a model’s performance.

This table allows comparison across different models and configurations, making it easier to select the best model for the final prediction task.

## Last Output Explanation

The final output in the notebook typically showcases the model’s predictions on either a test dataset or new data entries. Here, each row may represent an employee’s data with the following:

- **Employee ID:** A unique identifier for each employee.
- **Predicted Turnover Status:** The model’s prediction, which might label employees as either “Retained” or “Likely to Leave.”
- **Confidence Score (if available):** Indicates the probability or confidence level the model assigns to each prediction.

This final output helps HR teams understand which employees are at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention efforts.
